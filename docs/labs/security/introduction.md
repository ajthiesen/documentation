# Introduction

Welcome to the world of Example Incorporated! We're a global company that specializes in creating awesome widgets. Our offices are spread across the globe, and we've got all the modern bells and whistles you'd expect from a cutting-edge organization.

At Example Incorporated, our networked branch offices are equipped with a variety of computers that play different roles. Some are workstations, others are firewalls, and there are also servers for various purposes like: file storage, web hosting, email management, databases, applications, security and more.

As you read through this manual, imagine yourself as an administrator at one of our branch offices. You'll be working closely with a partner who shares the same responsibilities. Together, your mission is to keep our systems up and running smoothly 24/7.

We pride ourselves on maintaining high standards and utilizing top-notch hardware and software, which is why we've chosen Rocky Linux for our systems. It aligns with our stringent requirements and ensures we deliver the best widgets to our customers.

Now, let's talk about how you'll be interacting with the Linux Operating System we use. You have two options: the command line interface or _CLI_ (the shell) and the graphical user interface (GUI). In this manual, we'll primarily focus on the command line because it's an efficient way to get things done. Once you feel comfortable navigating the command line, you'll be equipped to handle any task that comes your way.

One of the great things about Linux is that the command line experience remains consistent across different distro. So, no matter which flavor of Linux you encounter (Rocky, Ubuntu, Red Hat, etc.), you'll find its look, feel, and functionality to be familiar and reliable.

Get ready to embark on an exciting journey of mastering the command line. By the time you finish this manual, you'll be a pro at unleashing the full potential of Linux through the power of command-line magic. Let's dive in and get started!
